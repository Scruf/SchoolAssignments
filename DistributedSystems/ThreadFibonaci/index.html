<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>
Write a Java program that uses multiple threads
to learn about thread creation, execution, synchronization, and termination.

<P>
<B>Help with your project:</B>
I am willing to help you with the design of your project.
I am willing to help you debug your project if the code isn't working.
However, for help with design or debugging issues
<I>you must come see me in person.</I>
Either visit me during office hours
or make an appointment.
I will not help you with design or debugging issues via email.
If it's the evening of the project deadline
and I have gone home,
you are on your own.
Plan and work ahead
so there will be plenty of time
for me to help you if necessary.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="system"><H3>Generalized Fibonacci Number</H3></A>

<P>
The generalized Fibonacci number <I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>),
<I>n</I> &ge; 0,
with parameters <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>,
is defined recursively as

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(0) = <I>a</I>
<BR><I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(1) = <I>b</I>
<BR><I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>) =
<I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>&minus;1) +
<I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>&minus;2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One way to compute <I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>)
uses an array <B>F</B>
that stores all the intermediate values
from <I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(0)
to <I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>).
Here is an example
showing how <I>f</I><SUB>5,7</SUB>(9)
is computed:

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig01.png"></CENTER>

<P>
You will write a multithreaded Java program
to compute the generalized Fibonacci number
specified by the parameters <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>
and the argument <I>n</I>,
using the array-based approach described above.
The program gets the parameters from the command line.
The program prints <I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>).
Here is an example computing <I>f</I><SUB>5,7</SUB>(100):
<PRE>
$ java Fib 5 7 100
3574188916427609250655
</PRE>

<P>
Because the Fibonacci number is an exponential function of <I>n</I>,
you cannot use type <TT>int</TT> or type <TT>long</TT>
to do the calculations.
If you do, the calculations will overflow,
and the program will get the wrong answer.
Instead, you must use class java.math.BigInteger.
The argument <I>n</I>, however, will be type <TT>int</TT>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="softwarereqts"><H3>Software Requirements</H3></A>

<OL TYPE=1>

<P><LI>
The program must be run by typing this command line:
<PRE>
    java Fib &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;n&gt;
</PRE>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
The first argument is the parameter <I>a</I>;
it must be a big integer (class java.math.BigInteger).
<LI>
The second argument is the parameter <I>b</I>;
it must be a big integer (class java.math.BigInteger).
<LI>
The third argument is the argument <I>n</I>;
it must be an integer &ge; 0 (type <TT>int</TT>).
</OL>
<BR><I>Note:</I>
This means that the program's class
must be named <TT>Fib</TT>,
and this class must not be in a package.

<P><LI>
If the command line does not have the required number of arguments,
or if any argument is erroneous,
the program must print a usage message on the console
and must exit.
The usage message must describe the problem.
The wording of the usage message is up to you.

<P><LI>
The program must print one line on the console.
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
The line's contents must be the number
<I>f</I><SUB><I>a,b</I></SUB>(<I>n</I>).
<LI>
There must be no space characters
before the number or after the number.
<LI>
The output must be terminated by a newline.
</OL>

<P><LI>
If the program encounters any error condition,
the program must print an error message on the console
and must exit.
The error message must describe the problem.
The wording of the error message is up to you.

<P>
<I>Note:
If your program's output does not conform <B>exactly</B>
to Software Requirements 1 through 4,
<B>you will lose credit</B> on your project.</I>
See the <A HREF="#grading">Grading Criteria</A> below.

</OL>

<!--

<P>
<A NAME="clarifications"><H4>Clarifications</H4></A>

<P>
<I>Q:</I>
What should the program do if it tries to create too many threads?
<BR>
<I>A:</I>
The JVM will throw an exception if this happens.
That is an error condition; see Requirement 4.
(I do not plan to have test cases
that make the program create too many threads, though.)

-->

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="softwaredesign"><H3>Software Design Criteria</H3></A>

<OL TYPE=1>

<P><LI>
The program must consist of the following classes,
and no other classes.
<OL TYPE=a>
<P><LI>
A monitor class containing the <B>F</B> array.
The monitor class must have the following public methods,
and no other public methods.
<UL>
<P><LI>
Constructor <TT>(int n)</TT>.
This constructor initializes the monitor
to calculate the generalized Fibonacci number
for argument <I>n</I>.
<P><LI>
<TT>void putValue (int i, BigInteger value)</TT>.
This method puts the given <TT>value</TT>
into array element <TT>i</TT>.
It is an error
if a value
has already been put into array element <TT>i</TT>.
<P><LI>
<TT>BigInteger getValue (int i)</TT>.
This method returns the value stored
in array element <TT>i</TT>.
This method does not return
until array element <TT>i</TT>
has been put.
</UL>
<P><LI>
A thread that prints the output.
<P><LI>
A thread that computes <I>one and only one</I> array element
and stores it in the monitor.
There is a separate instance of this thread
<I>for each array element,</I>
including array elements 0 and 1.
<P><LI>
A main program.
The main program must create the above objects.
The main program must start the threads <I>in this order:</I>
first the output printing thread,
then the thread that computes the last array element,
then the thread that computes
the next-to-last array element,
and so on backwards through the array elements.
The main program must <I>not</I> wait for the threads to terminate.
The main program <I>must not do anything else.</I>
</OL>

<P><LI>
The program must
follow the thread programming patterns studied in class.

<P><LI>
The program must
be designed using object oriented design principles as appropriate.

<P><LI>
The program must
make use of reusable software components as appropriate.

<P><LI>
Each class or interface
must include a Javadoc comment
describing the overall class or interface.

<P><LI>
Each method within each class or interface
must include a Javadoc comment
describing the overall method,
the arguments if any,
the return value if any,
and the exceptions thrown if any.
<P>
<I>Note:</I>
See my Java source files which we studied in class
for the style of Javadoc comments I'm looking for.

<P>
<I>Note:
If your program's design does not conform
to Software Design Criteria 1 through 6,
<B>you will lose credit</B> on your project.</I>
See the <A HREF="#grading">Grading Criteria</A> below.

</OL>

<P>
<A NAME="designclarifications"><H4>Clarifications</H4></A>

<P>
<I>Q:</I>
Can the monitor class have hidden (private) methods?
<BR>
<I>A:</I>
Yes, the monitor class can have private methods.
Software Design Criterion 1a has been changed
to refer to public methods.

-->

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="submissionreqts"><H3>Submission Requirements</H3></A>

<P>
Your project submission will consist of a ZIP file
containing the Java source file for every class and interface
in your project.
Put all the source files into a ZIP file
named <TT>"&lt;username&gt;.zip"</TT>,
replacing <TT>&lt;username&gt;</TT> with the user name
from your Computer Science Department account.
On a Linux system, the command for creating a ZIP file is:

<P>
<TT>zip &lt;username&gt;.zip *.java</TT>

<P>
Send your ZIP file to me by email at
ark<FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFFFF">&shy;</FONT>&#64;<FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFFFF">&shy;</FONT>cs.rit.edu.
Include your full name and your computer account name
in the email message,
and include the ZIP file as an attachment.

<P>
When I get your email message,
I will extract the contents of your ZIP file
into a directory.
I will set my Java class path
to include the directory where I extracted your files,
as well as the Parallel Java 2 Library.
I will compile all the Java source files in your program
using the JDK 1.8 compiler.
I will then send you a reply message
acknowledging I received your project
and stating whether I was able to compile all the source files.
If you have not received a reply
within one day,
please contact me.
Your project is not successfully submitted
until I have sent you an acknowledgment
stating I was able to compile all the source files.

<P>
The submission deadline is Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 11:59pm.
The date/time at which your email message arrives in my inbox
will determine whether your project meets the deadline.

<P>
You may submit your project multiple times up until the deadline.
I will keep and grade only the most recent successful submission.
There is no penalty for multiple submissions.

<P>
If you submit your project before the deadline,
but I do not accept it
(e.g. I can't compile all the source files),
and you cannot or do not submit your project again before the deadline,
the project will be late (see below).
<B><I>I strongly advise you to submit the project
several days BEFORE the deadline,
so there will be time to deal with any problems
that may arise in the submission process.</I></B>

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="grading"><H3>Grading Criteria</H3></A>

<P>
I will grade your project by:
<UL>
<P><LI>
(10 points) Evaluating the design of your program,
as documented in the Javadoc
and as implemented in the source code.
<UL>
<LI>
All of the <A HREF="#softwaredesign">Software Design Criteria</A>
are fully met: 10 points.
<LI>
Some of the <A HREF="#softwaredesign">Software Design Criteria</A>
are not fully met: 0 points.
</UL>
<P><LI>
(20 points) Running your project.
There will be twenty test cases, each worth 1 point.
For each test case,
if the program runs using the command line in Requirement 1
and the program produces the correct output,
the test case will get 1 point,
otherwise the test case will get 0 points.
"Correct output" means
"output fulfills <I>all</I> the
<A HREF="#softwarereqts">Software Requirements</A>
<I>exactly.</I>"
<P><LI>
(30 points) Total.
</UL>

<P>
When I run your program,
the Java class path will point to the directory
with your compiled class files,
as well as the Parallel Java 2 Library.
I will use JDK 1.8 to run your program.

<P>
I will grade the test cases
based <I>solely</I> on whether your program produces the correct output
as specified in the above <A HREF="#softwarereqts">Software Requirements</A>.
<I>Any</I> deviation from the requirements
will result in a grade of 0 for the test case.
This includes errors in the formatting (such as extra spaces),
incorrect uppercase/lowercase,
output lines not terminated with a newline,
extra newline(s) in the output,
and extraneous output not called for in the requirements.
The requirements state <I>exactly</I> what the output is supposed to be,
and there is no excuse for outputting anything different.
If any requirement is unclear, please ask for clarification.

<P>
If there is a defect in your program
and that same defect causes multiple test cases to fail,
I will deduct points for <I>every</I> failing test case.
The number of points deducted does <I>not</I> depend
on the size of the defect;
I will deduct the same number of points
whether the defect is 1 line, 10 lines, 100 lines, or whatever.

<P>
After grading your project
I will put your grade and any comments I have
in your encrypted grade file.
For further information,
see the <A HREF="../policies.shtml">Course Grading and Policies</A>
and the <A HREF="../encryptedgrades.shtml">Encrypted Grades</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="late"><H3>Late Projects</H3></A>

<P>
If I have not received a successful submission of your project
by the deadline,
your project will be late
and will receive a grade of zero.
You may request an extension
for the project.
There is no penalty for an extension.
See the Course Policies for my
<A HREF="../policies.shtml#extensions">policy on extensions</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="plagiarism"><H3>Plagiarism</H3></A>

<P>
Programming Project 1 must be entirely your own individual work.
I will not tolerate plagiarism.
If in my judgment
the project is not entirely your own work,
you will automatically receive, as a minimum,
a grade of zero for the assignment.
See the Course Policies for my
<A HREF="../policies.shtml#plagiarism">policy on plagiarism</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="resubmission"><H3>Resubmission</H3></A>

<P>
If you so choose,
you may submit a revised version of your project
after you have received the grade for the original version.
However, if the original project was not successfully submitted
by the (possibly extended) deadline
or was not entirely your own work (i.e., plagiarized),
you are not allowed to submit a revised version.
Submit the revised version via email
in the same way as the original version.
<!--
I will accept a resubmission
up until 11:59pm Friday 26-Feb-2016.
-->
I will accept a resubmission
up until three days after
the grades for the original version are released.
The resubmission deadline will be announced
on the <A HREF="../whatsnew.shtml">What's New</A> page
and in the <A HREF="../schedule.shtml">Course Schedule</A>.
You may resubmit your project multiple times up until the deadline;
I will keep and grade only the most recent successful resubmission;
there is no penalty for multiple resubmissions.
I will grade the revised version
using the same criteria as the original version,
then I will subtract 3 points
(10% of the maximum possible points)
as a resubmission penalty.
The revised grade will replace the original grade,
even if the revised grade is less than the original grade.
